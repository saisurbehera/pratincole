### Why the name?

This project is named after the elegant Pratincole (Glareola pratincola), a graceful wading bird known for its agility and swift movements across wetlands. These remarkable birds are masters of efficient navigation, expertly skimming water surfaces to catch insects with precision.

Much like these nimble aviators, this project aims to navigate the Factorio ecosystem with speed and accuracy, gathering information with the same refined efficiency. ðŸŒ¿âœ¨
